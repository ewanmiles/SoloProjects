The `numpy` module has this capability, and allows the user to fit a polynomial curve with a user-defined order using the function `np.polyfit`. It is able to determine appropriate coefficients from the data, along with a matrix of covariance. Again, if there are multiple dataseries, it will expand the dataset to include all series under one array of $x$, $x\\space uncertainty$, $y$ and $y\\space uncertainty$.\n",

From there, you can make the decision to use a longer or shorter polynomial based on the change in $\\chi^2$ as the order $n$ increases; if $\\Delta y$ is accurate, $\\chi^2$ should plateau around 1, but may not. In this case the user's best judgement is required.\n",

    "The whiskers on box plots are typically used to represent the maximum and minimum of the dataset, giving a five-number summary: upper-quartile, mean, lower-quartile, maximum and minimum. However, there are other options. Sometimes, the whiskers can reach between the 9th and 91st percentile of the dataset. This program allows you to define which percentiles should give the range using an integer slider below; for example, setting it to \"9-91\" will give a boxplot with whiskers reaching from the 9th to 91st percentiles. To set the whiskers to the maximum and minimum of the dataset, simply set the range as 0-100."
