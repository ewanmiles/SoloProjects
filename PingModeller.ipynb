    "This script is essentially a simple make-up of two functions: **ping()** and **pingmodel()**, with the latter requiring the former.\n",
    "\n",
    "**ping()** uses subprocess to ping a user-input host address (typically a URL, e.g. \"google.com\", entered as a string). This means it sends a single arbitrary packet to the address and measures the time from departure to return, as a representation of connection strength. The data returned includes alot of information, but for the purposes of this script, **ping()** stringifies it and slices to the ping time only, returning it as a float.\n",
    "\n",
    "**pingmodel()** uses **ping()** repeatedly over a user-defined period, appending arrays with ping values in conjunction with the time at which the ping was sent, plotting the variation in ping (ms) across a time interval (s). Due to the structure of the function, _the graph does not plot until the time has passed_. It also features a break in the ping loop if packets do not return; it does this by checking if the ping array is filled with _None_ values only. A packet will not return if the connection is very slow, but likelihood is that, if no packets return over a few seconds, the host is not reachable (i.e. the user has likely input an incorrect URL).\n",
    "\n",
    "After running the module imports and defined functions, all that you need to do is run the last cell with **pingmodel()**, where the two arguments are the host name and the time interval over which to ping, respectively, e.g. `pingmodel(\"google.com\",30)`, which would ping google.com over 30 seconds and plot the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Great connections have ping averages in the range of 10-20ms, with low standard deviations.\n",
    "* Good connections have ping averages in the range of 40-60ms, with low to medium standard deviations (medium deviations usually caused by occasional \"spikes\" in ping).\n",
    "* Poor connections typically average over 150-200ms, or have high standard deviations, or both.\n",
    "* **Virtually non-existent connections typically average 1000ms+.** I have been unfortunate enough to be on these connections many a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "To give an idea of what the ping represents, playing a game on 1000ms ping means that any controls by the player will be registered in-game after (around) a one second delay."
